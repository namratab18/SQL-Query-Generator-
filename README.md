Streamlit App: SQL Query Generator ðŸ“Š
This project provides a user-friendly interface to generate SQL queries from natural language descriptions. It utilizes the Gemini AI model from Google AI and connects to a local SQLite database named "student.db".

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later
streamlit package
dotenv package
Google AI account and API key for the Gemini model
sqlite3 package (usually comes pre-installed)
Installation
Clone this repository.

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate.bat
# you can use conda env also
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Usage
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the .env file with your actual Google AI API key.

Run the app:

streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.

Explanation
The app.py file contains the main logic of the application. It:
Loads the necessary libraries and configures Gemini AI using the API key.
Defines a prompt explaining the functionality of the app.
Uses st.text_input to create a text box where users can enter their natural language question.
Uses a button (st.button) to trigger the query generation process.
Upon clicking the button, it uses the get_gemini_response function to send the user question and prompt to the Gemini model and retrieve the generated SQL query.
It then calls the read_sql function to execute the generated query on the "student.db" and displays the results.
Implements basic error handling to handle potential issues.
Additional Notes
This example uses a simple database with sample data. You can modify the code to connect to and work with your specific database.
The code utilizes the Streamlit library for building the user interface. Refer to the Streamlit documentation for more information on customizing the app design and functionalities.
Consider adding comments to your code to improve readability and maintainability.
